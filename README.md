# Why
The purpose of this Angular project is to play with and get familiarity with the canvas element, particularly with the 2d rendering context. Currently, there are functions setup to draw some various basic shapes using the Canvas API with TypeScript. You can comment/uncomment them one by one to see them each drawn from the canvas component.

# In the works
The project is a work in progress, and I will be adding to it as I have more time to play with it.

# In the future
I hope to add animation to this and more complex drawings. I may even delve into 3D. I will try to add some math related notes or comments as I learn more as well, as the values used to create the shapes may not be intuitive to everyone.
